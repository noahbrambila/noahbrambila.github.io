                    <p>To maximize student engagement and success, school-wide events should prioritize student-focused planning that incorporates direct scholar feedback. Implementing simple tools like idea submission boxes encourages creative contributions and fosters a sense of ownership, as evidenced by the record attendance at recent student-influenced dances. Ultimately, active student involvement transforms social events into meaningful experiences, ensuring that activities truly reflect the needs and hopes of the entire student body.</p>

                    <p>Student involvement is critical to any school, small incentives can help. Whether it's recognition programs, participation rewards, or exclusive opportunities, I'll work to create systems that encourage students to get involved and stay engaged with school activities.</p>

                    <p>ASB has taught me a lot of things. One of these things is that <u>better events take better planning.</u> Organization is <b>critical</b> to the success of any dance, and this is known by everyone. Unlike everyone, I’m taking action - <i>here’s how.</i></p>

                    <p>Working on dances until the last minute isn't a <i>choice.</i> It's a product of bad coordination. By implementing better planning systems and earlier deadlines, we can ensure every event is executed smoothly and professionally, giving students the quality experiences they deserve.</p>
